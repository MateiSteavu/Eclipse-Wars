# Eclipse-Wars
A video game developed in Roblox Studio.

This is my absolutely first project ever. It is a shooter developed in Roblox Studio.
I was in 8th grade when I wrote my first lines of code for this project.

I was the project leader (we were a team of about 4 devs, all in 8th or 9th grade),
and the software developer. We eventually stopped working on it as most of us found
other passions and it was a rather complex first project.

Of course, neither one of us knew what we were doing, but here is a link where you can try it out.
