I will not post the entire code here as it cumulates with thousands of lines of code
and I think it is more beneficial if you look things up yourself. I built this project
when I was 8 so things should not be too complicated for you.

Nevertheless, I will post some code samples and you can contact me in any way if you have
more questions about the project.

P.S. If you want to build a game in Roblox Studio, please do not. Just use Unity, UE or
Godot, those applications are MUCH better.
